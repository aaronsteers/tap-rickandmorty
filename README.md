## Installation

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/aaronsteers/tap-rickandmorty.git
```

### Source Authentication and Authorization

This tap runs fine with zero config. No auth is needed! ðŸ™Œ

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-rickandmorty` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](www.meltano.com).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-rickandmorty --version
tap-rickandmorty --help
tap-rickandmorty --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` As a first step, scan the entire project for the text "`TODO:`" and complete any recommended steps, deleting the "TODO" references once completed.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_rickandmorty/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-rickandmorty` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-rickandmorty --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in
the file.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-rickandmorty
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-rickandmorty --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-rickandmorty target-jsonl
```
